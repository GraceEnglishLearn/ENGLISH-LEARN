# 2.1.10. `ɤ`

人类的语音在最底层是相通的 —— 最明显的例证就是所有的语言都一样，不仅都以元音为核心，并且，都有大致相同的基础元音音素，比如 `ɑ`、`i`、`ʊ`、`e`、`ɔ`…… 日文就恰好只有这五个母音。英文还另外有一个 `ə`；而韩文比英文还要多出一个 `ɤ`<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-other="/audios/us/Close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel.ogg.mp3"></span>（韩文字符为 `ᅳ`） —— 这个音中文也有，比如，在 “思念” 这个词中， “思”（`sī`）的韵母就是这个音。

Human speech, at its core, is universal - the clearest example being that all languages share certain fundamental tenets. Every language places vowels at their heart and maintains a similar basic vowel phonemes such as `ɑ`, `i`, `ʊ`, `e`, `ɔ`, amongst others. Take Japanese for instance; it uses precisely these five vowels only. English includes one more: `ə`. Korean even outpaces English by adding another one —`ɤ`<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-other="/audios/us/Close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel.ogg.mp3"></span> (represented in Hangul as `ᅳ`). Interestingly enough you can find this sound in Mandarin Chinese too — like in `sī` of "思念" `sīniàn`, meaning to miss or remember.

虽然英文的音标列表里并没有收录 `ɤ` 这个音，可实际上，你试试就知道了：`d` 被读作 `dɤ`，`g` 被读作 `gɤ` —— 其中的 `ɤ` 很轻很短；同样，`t` 实际上被读作 `tɤ`，`k` 被读作 `kɤ` —— 其中的 `ɤ` 没有气流振动。

Even though the phonetic symbol `ɤ` isn't included in English phonetic chart, you'll notice something interesting if you try it out: the letter `d` is actually pronounced as `dɤ`, and `g` is pronounced as `gɤ`. Here, the `ɤ` sound is very light and brief. Similarly, `t` is actually pronounced as `tɤ`, and `k` is pronounced as `kɤ`, with the `ɤ` not involving any airflow vibration.
