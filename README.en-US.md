Method 2: If you want to **try out updated versions** at any time, follow these steps.

### For MacOS Users

1. Open the Terminal command line tool.
2. Install Homebrew (refer to this article: 《[从 Terminal 开始…](https://github.com/xiaolai/apple-computer-literacy/blob/main/start-from-terminal.md)》）
3. Install `nodejs` and `yarn`:

   ```bash
   brew install nvm
   nvm install 20.5.1 
   brew install ffmpeg
   brew install yarn
   ```

4. Clone this repository locally and then install and launch:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir github
   cd github
   git clone https://github.com/xiaolai/everyone-can-use-english
   cd ~/github/everyone-can-use-english
   yarn install
   yarn start:enjoy
   ```

5. To restart the application, use Terminal:

### For Windows Users

System requirements: Windows 10 version 22H2 or later, [Windows PowerShell 5.1](https://aka.ms/wmf5download) or later, stable internet connection.

1. Right-click on the "Windows logo" in the taskbar and choose "PowerShell".

   > Tips 1: On the latest Windows 11, you may not see the "PowerShell" option, only "Terminal".
   >
   > Tips 2: Do not run PowerShell with administrator privileges, as it may cause Scoop installation failure.

2. In the opened PowerShell window, execute the following commands to install Scoop:

   ```powershell
   # Set PowerShell execution policy
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   # Download installation script
   irm get.scoop.sh -outfile 'install.ps1'
   # Execute installation, --ScoopDir parameter specifies the Scoop installation path
   .\install.ps1 -ScoopDir 'C:\Scoop'
   ````

If you encounter the error:

> `<span style="color:red">`irm :  Could not resolve this remote name:  'raw.githubusercontent.com'

It indicates a **network connection** problem; please resolve it on your own.

npm install yarn -D
````
